// Render with Asciidoctor

= Jacques CTF
v0.1
Philippe Proulx

**_Jacques{nbsp}CTF_** is a https://diamon.org/ctf/[CTF] trace inspection
tool with a text (terminal) user interface.

Like Jacques Cartier, Jacques{nbsp}CTF can explore the sea of bits of a
CTF data stream file and discover unsuspected lands of problems within
packets.


== Features

* Full hexadecimal and binary packet data inspection with:
** Current data type or event record type (metadata) with highlight.
** ASCII equivalent of data bytes (like your typical hex editor).
** Packet data offsets in decimal or hexadecimal, bytes or bits.
** Padding regions shown with a different color.
** Decoding error region clearly shown, if any, with textual details.
** Current datum path (metadata), size, byte order, and decoded value.
** Current event record details:
*** Index within packet.
*** Offset within packet.
*** Size.
*** Type name.
*** Type ID.
*** Timestamp (first).
*** Duration since last event record.
** Custom bookmarks to mark regions and return to them.
** Search or go to a region by:
*** Packet index within its data stream file.
*** Packet sequence number.
*** Event record index within its packet.
*** Offset within packet or data stream file.
*** Timestamp (nanoseconds from origin or cycles).
*** Event record with type name.
*** Event record with type ID.
* Anywhere in the application, you can change the current timestamp
  format (full date and time, nanoseconds since origin, or cycles) or
  size format (B/KiB/MiB/GiB, bytes and extra bits, and bits) of tables.
* Packet table with details:
** Index within data stream file.
** Offset within data stream file.
** Total size.
** Content size.
** Beginning and end timestamps, and duration.
** Event record count.
** Data stream type and data stream IDs.
** Sequence number.
** Discarded event record counter value.
* Data stream file table with details:
** Path.
** File size.
** Packet count.
** Beginning and end timestamps, and duration.
** Data stream type and data stream IDs.
* Trace details:
** Number of data stream files, data streams, and packets.
** Effective and expected packet total and content sizes.
** Intersection and disjoint set timestamps and durations.
** Metadata stream information.
* Data type (metadata) explorer:
** Data stream types (packet header and context, event record header and
   first context).
** Event record types (event record header, contexts, and payload).


== Build and install

Make sure you have the build time requirements:

* Linux/Unix platform
* https://cmake.org/[CMake] ≥ 3.1.0
* pass:[C++14] compiler
* http://www.boost.org/[Boost] ≥ 1.58
* https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/[ncurses]
* Latest version of https://github.com/eepp/yactfr[yactfr]

.Build and install Jacques CTF from source
----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..
make
make install
----

You can specify your favorite C and pass:[C++] compilers with the usual
`CC` and `CXX` environment variables when you run `cmake`, and
additional options with `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS`.

Specify `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_PREFIX_` to `cmake` to install
Jacques{nbsp}CTF to the `_PREFIX_` directory instead of the default
`/usr/local` directory.
